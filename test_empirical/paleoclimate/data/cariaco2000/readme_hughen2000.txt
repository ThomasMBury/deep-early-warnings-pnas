DESCRIPTION: 
Cariaco Basin 2000 Deglacial 14C and Grey Scale Data.

Cariaco2000_pc56_greyscale.txt is updated from earlier 
published data, with a new age model. 

Cariaco2000_pc58_14C.txt are new 14C data based on sampling of 
high deposition rate core PL07-58PC, and are distinct from 
previously published 14C data from core PL07-56PC.  
The calendar ages are based on an updated varve chronology 
from core PL07-58PC, anchored to tree rings. The grey scale data 
are from core PL07-56PC.  The grey scale calendar chronology 
is based from 0-9 ka on 14C ages calibrated using CALIB 4, 
and based from 9-14.8 ka on the updated varve chronology.
